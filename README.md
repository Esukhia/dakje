Dev here: https://github.com/nuwainfo/tibetaneditor

This PyQt5 project is a beta version of readability editor for the Tibetan language.

The readability editor assesses the readability of a text by highlighting words according to their level of difficulty. Levels of frequency are defined by analysing the frequency of words in a given language.

The beta version allows users to:

1. write or paste text in the editor
2. segment and highlight the text by clicking on the segment icon

To test the tool, paste the text from test_source.txt in the editor and click the segmentation icon. The result should look like this:

- POS tagging
- spell-checking
- rules and vocab list editing for segmentation/POS tagging/spell-checking
- suggestion of spelling correction
- suggestion of vocabulary alternative
